Approximate change log for TUXAUDIO by version.

(For more detailed changes, see svn log.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current: 

Version 0.9.1:
  * Improved the timing to avoid a bad audio quality on some Tux.

Version 0.9.0:
  * Fixed severals bugs
  * Added versionning of the RF boards
  * Improved the sleep mode

Version 0.6.0:

  X Nothing changed on tuxaudio.

Version 0.5.2:

  * Increased the power-up delay of the RF that seems too short on some tuxs.

Version 0.5.1:

  * Changed the initialization of the RF and powering of the microphone.
    Sometimes the RF didn't start correctly because of this.

Version 0.5.0:

  * Refactoring of the I2C communication between tuxcore and tuxaudio. Multi-
    master has been dropped in favor of a master-slave communication.
    Communications should now be more reliable.

  * Added 2 modules: parser and misc. The parser functions spread in main.c and
    communication.c are now merged into one function in parser.c. All commands
    coming from the RF and tuxcore will be parsed by the same function.

  * All fifo now use the fifo module.

  * Power saving for sleep added in the flash module.

  * Simpler audio stack adaptation.

  * Bug fixes (specially in the flash module) and cleanup.

Version 0.4.0:

  * Completely refactored the internal sounds storage and the data flash
    handling to better support the audio flash application. A couple of status
    regarding internal sounds have been added.

  * Improved doxygen documentation, now available at http://doc.tuxisalive.com

Version 0.3.1:

  * Versioning of the firmware now has a variation field and a release_type to
    mark final releases.

  * Reviewed the flash playing function to use a fifo and to be able to keep
    sending the status when a sound is played from the sound flash. Some new
    status are now also sent during playing and programming of the sound flash
    memory. Bug fixes too.

  * Refactored the audio flash module and the flash functions are now moved to
    their own module (AT26F004), many bug fixes.

  * Imroved the powering of the microphone, the sounds that were heard at
    startup should now be gone.

  * Added the basis for the sleep functions although they are unfinished and
    untested.

  * Added programming directives in the Makefile for tuxup, stk500 and jtagice
    mkii.  

  * Some cleanup.

  * Fixed #1 with the patches given by Philippe Teuwen, this now
    fixes the location of the version, revision and author structures with a
    linker script in the .version section otherwise gcc is free to change the
    order. This also fixes the position of the cpu_nbr and ver_major bits in
    the byte as again gcc is free to change that order though this is much less
    likely to happen.

Version 0.3.0:

  * Initial public release. This code is considered stable.

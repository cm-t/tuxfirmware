Approximate change log for TUXCORE by version.

(For more detailed changes, see svn log.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current:

Version 0.9.1:
  * Fixed a bug with the timeout.

Version 0.9.0:
  * Added timeouts on the motors
  * Fixed a bug with the flippers reset sequence
  * Decreased the braking delays
  * Improved the sleep mode

Version 0.6.0:

  * Changed the motor drivers to strong output for the mainboard produced by
    pacific which doesn't behave the same as the old board. In order to avoid
    speaker noises when the motor are braked, there's a hardware revision
    variable which differentiate the 2 types of boards. The old boards keep
    the same configuration of the motor drivers while the new boards have the
    strong outputs and an decreased resistor on the VCC switch to avoid
    speaker noises.

Version 0.5.2:

  * Fixed some standalone commands that were not executed anymore (at
    startup mainly).

Version 0.5.1:

  * Added a timeout protection on each motor.

  * When connections and disconnections occur while the standalone can't
    process them (at startup) or too rapidly, both connection and disconnection
    flags were raised and not necessarily processed in the correct order.

Version 0.5.0:

  * Refactoring of the I2C communication between tuxcore and tuxaudio. Multi-
    master has been dropped in favor of a master-slave communication.
    Communications should now be more reliable.

  * Moved the pong function so that they are sent as fast as possible, not one
    every 100ms anymore. This should point more communication problems in this
    worst case.

  * Added motor states in the status.

Version 0.4.0:

  * Complete rework of the led functions to support intensity control and
    fading/pulsing effects.

  * Improved the movement commands and fixed a couple of bugs/limitations.
    Eyes, mouth, flippers and spinning were all reviewed completely. All
    functions seems to better mix together. New functions were added to control
    the motors either by the number of movements or by duration. So it's now
    possible to have very short movements of a few milliseconds.

  * Added a protection on IR RC5 receiver code so that only codes from kysoh's
    remote are considered valid. The IR functions need to be refactored in
    order to support any protcol. But for now I just improved the reliability
    by rejecting wrong codes.

  * Can now detect when a remote button is pressed or released. Earlier the
    IR code was only sent once when the button was pressed, now it's sent
    continuously.

  * Removed the greeting function completely, it was buggy and should probably
    be implemented by software instead of firmware anyway.

  * Improved doxygen documentation, now available at http://doc.tuxisalive.com

Version 0.3.1:

  * Added battery level measurement. The ADC module has been completely
    refactored.

  * Reorganization of commands.h is on the way.

  * Versioning of the firmware now has a variation field and a release_type to
    mark final releases.

  * Added doxygen configuration file. The documentation can be founf online at
    http://doc.tuxisalive.com.

  * Light measurement is now correctly processed in the daemon to have a
    somehow linear curve from the 2 different types of measurements (different
    resisotr values). Thresholds for changing the resistor have been updated.

  * Major cleanup and commenting. Motor and led modules are considered clean.

  * Fixed #6 nd #9 about the leds that were not updated when the eyes were
    closed.

  * Fixed #7 about the eyes commands.

  * Fixed #8 about the flipper movements.
 
  * Added the missing commands for the motors: CLOSE_EYES_CMD, RAISE_WINGS_CMD,
    LOWER_WINGS_CMD, etc.

  * Added the basis for the sleep functions although they are unfinished and
    untested.

  * BUG: when 2 events are happening at the same time, they are conflicting in
    the event manager.

  * Added programming directives in the Makefile for tuxup, stk500 and jtagice
    mkii.  

  * Fixed #1 with the patches given by Philippe Teuwen, this now
    fixes the location of the version, revision and author structures with a
    linker script in the .version section otherwise gcc is free to change the
    order. This also fixes the position of the cpu_nbr and ver_major bits in
    the byte as again gcc is free to change that order though this is much less
    likely to happen.

Version 0.3.0:

  * Initial public release. This code is considered stable. Most
    functionalities are implemented. Handling now all movements, IR emitter, IR
    receiver, phototransistor, blue led's and I2C communication. There's also a
    standalone behavior implemented but still not configurable from the
    computer.
